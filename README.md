Silinosic-X is a Python intelligence framework for authorized OSINT work. It combines profile reconnaissance, domain-surface analysis, fusion scoring, public-media reconnaissance, and OCR image scanning into one runtime with plugins, filters, engine policies, and categorized artifacts.

## What v11.2.0 includes

- Reporter is now the primary reporting layer for HTML and CLI summaries.
- Media reconnaissance and OCR image scanning are first-class lanes instead of side notes.
- HTML artifacts are organized as case views with graphs, categorized sections, extension drill-downs, vulnerability context, and a closing `Reporter Brief`.
- The docs tree and website are aligned to the current runtime instead of old release-planning notes.

## Recent runtime additions

- Platform intelligence now loads from an expanded manifest with `91` validated platforms, including major high-value public OSINT surfaces.
- Profile scanning can emit live pipeline events as platforms resolve, allowing downstream enrichment to start before the full scan ends.
- Live enrichment now hunts contact and credential signals from `FOUND` profile rows during the scan itself.
- A persistent SQLite knowledge base tracks targets, found profiles, contact signals, fingerprints, and risk indicators across runs.
- `silinosic-x doctor` now reports engine health, knowledge-base status, and Docker runtime status.
- Docker is now a first-class execution path through `--docker`, with runtime detection, image build support, and mounted output persistence.
- Tor runtime management now has a higher-level setup layer that can deploy `torrc`, check readiness, and coordinate startup.

## Core workflows

- `profile` scans usernames and public profiles across platform manifests.
- `surface` analyzes domain exposure, transport posture, and surface intelligence.
- `fusion` correlates profile and surface evidence into scored intelligence.
- `orchestrate` runs the policy-led orchestration pipeline directly.
- `ocr` runs dedicated OCR image scanning across local paths and remote URLs.
- media plugins add public image/video/post-text reconnaissance and stego-style triage.

## Install, run, import

```bash
pip install silinosic-x
silinosic-x
silinosic-x doctor
```

```python
import silinosic_x

print(silinosic_x.__version__)
```
> Note: the Python-PIP package is not available right now cause changing repo name...

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voltsparx/Silinosic-X.git
cd Silinosic-X
pip install -e .
silinosic-x --help
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install ".[reports]"
pip install ".[ocr]"
```

`pytesseract` is a Python wrapper, but OCR still depends on a reachable `tesseract` binary. Silinosic-X now reports which OCR/image backends were actually available during the run, and `silinosic-x doctor` gives a quick local diagnostic pass for OCR, Tor, Reporter backends, output settings, and runtime inventory.

Docker runtime:

```bash
silinosic-x --docker
silinosic-x prompt --docker
silinosic-x profile alice --docker
silinosic-x surface example.com --docker
silinosic-x prompt --docker --tor
```

On first use, Silinosic-X can check Docker, install it when supported and approved, build the image, and then launch the requested command inside the container.

## Quick examples

```bash
silinosic-x profile alice --html
silinosic-x surface example.com --html
silinosic-x fusion alice example.com --html
silinosic-x ocr ./captures/poster.png --url https://example.com/image.png --html
silinosic-x profile alice --plugin media_recon_engine --plugin post_signal_intel --plugin stego_signal_probe --html
silinosic-x prompt
silinosic-x prompt --docker
silinosic-x doctor
```

## Reporter outputs

Silinosic-X writes artifacts under `output/` and can emit:

- CLI summaries
- JSON payloads
- CSV exports plus companion CSV slices
- HTML Reporter case views
- SQLite case stores
- DOCX case documents
- PDF case documents
- run logs and framework logs

Reporter is designed to make the result easier to triage by grouping identity findings, reliability issues, correlation, vulnerabilities, plugin/filter signals, OCR/media lanes, and the final `Reporter Brief`.

Recent report/runtime improvements also include:

- live enrichment sections in HTML output when profile pipeline signals are captured
- relationship and graph-backed sections for fusion-style analysis
- persistent knowledge-base storage at `output/silinosic_x_kb.db`
- richer `doctor` visibility for OCR, Tor, Docker, engines, and output/runtime state

In prompt mode, attachables can be configured as session defaults with commands like:

```text
enable plugin threat_conductor
enable filter contact_canonicalizer
enable module source-pack-01-module-1
config
```

## Website and Pages

Primary Pages URL:

- `https://voltsparx.github.io/Silinosic-X/`

If that direct URL shows GitHub's "site not found" page, the usual cause is not the website files themselves. It usually means GitHub Pages is not currently serving the project site yet. For this repository, Pages must be enabled with `GitHub Actions` as the source, and the `Silinosic-X Pages` workflow must complete successfully on `main` or `master`.

## Safety

- Legal and authorized use only
- Respect platform terms, privacy, and local law
- Do not use Silinosic-X for stalking, harassment, or unauthorized surveillance

## Developer notes

Useful local checks:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
python -m compileall -q core filters modules plugins tests silinosic-x.py
python scripts/smoke_suite.py
silinosic-x doctor
silinosic-x --help
```

Core package naming:

- package install name: `silinosic-x`
- CLI entrypoint: `silinosic-x`
- Python import path: `silinosic_x`
